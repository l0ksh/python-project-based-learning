answer = """Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs by bundling properties and actions into individual objects.
For example, an object could represent a person with properties like name, age, and address, and actions like walking, talking, breathing, and running. \nOr it could represent an email with properties like a recipient list, subject, and body, and actions like adding attachments and sending.
\nIn simpler terms, OOP models real-world things, like cars, and relationships, like companies and employees or students and teachers, as software objects. \nThese objects have data and can perform actions. The main idea is that objects are central to OOP in Python, shaping both data and the program's structure, unlike other programming paradigms where objects only represent data.
\nAll four core aspects of a generic OOP framework are supported by Python's object-oriented programming system: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

\nQ1 What are Classes and Objects?
\nAnswer:
\nPython, like other object-oriented languages, lets you define classes to create objects. The most common data types in Python, like strings, lists, and dictionaries, are built-in classes.

A class is like a blueprint for creating objects, containing variables and methods that define the type of object. The variables in a class are called attributes.

An object is an instance of a class with a specific set of properties. You can use the same class to create as many objects as you need.
